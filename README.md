### Quiver
[Quiver (mathematics)](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Quiver_(mathematics)) is another name for a multidigraph, or a directed graph where loops between verticies are allowed. Quivers are used in representation theory consisting of a set of Verticies V and a set of edges E, where each edge is between exactly two verticies and has a direction.

This is an implementation of a Quiver as a data structure in Zig.
